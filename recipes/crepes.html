    <h2>These homemade crepes are ultra thin and delicate with the most buttery crisp edges. </h2>
    <p>Have you ever made these before? Though it may seem complicated, making restaurant-quality crepes at home isn’t very difficult.
        Today I’m walking you through the entire process including crucial success tips, the best 8 ingredients to use, why I use a blender,
        and a multitude of filling ideas.</p>
    <p>Crepes are thin and delicate French-style pancakes made without any leavener. When made correctly, they’re as thin as lace with irresistible
        buttery crisp edges. Crepes are popular at restaurants and catered events and I’ve even seen crepe stations at wedding receptions,
        too! Though they’re usually a breakfast or brunch option, crepes are welcome any time of day including dinner or dessert. Filled with 
        anything from whipped cream and berries to meats, sauce, and vegetables, crepes aren’t picky about when you enjoy them.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 eggs</li>
          <li>½ cup milk</li>
          <li>½ cup water</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Step. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine.Add the salt and 
          butter; beat until smooth.</p></li>
          <li><p>Step. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup 
            for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.<p></li>
          <li></p>Step. Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. 
         Serve hot.</p></li>
        </ol>
